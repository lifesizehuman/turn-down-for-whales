Turn Down for Whales
==============

Turn Down for Whales allows users to search for specific marine species and see the location of recent sightings on a map. Users can also enter their own sighting date, including:

- Species
-	Description
-	Location (latitude and longitude)
-	Time and Date

The site also features a random whale fact generator, an interactive map and resources for users interested in ocean conservation.

Motivation
--------
Turn Down for Whales was inspired by our love of the ocean and a desire to share information, both useful and fun, about whales and all of their marine friends. We hope people that love whales will learn something new, and that everyone can leave with a new appreciation for the amazing creatures that live in our oceans.
